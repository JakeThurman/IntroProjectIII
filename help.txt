The goal of the game is to get all of spaces with the same symbol to be in a column and all of the spaces with the same color to the same row.

You can swap two spaces by clicking the two you want to switch. When you click the first, you should see a checkmark appear over that space. If you clicked the wrong space, click that space again or anywhere outside the sameboard to clear your selection.

Be careful making swaps, as you only have a certain number of swaps allowed before you lose!

Have Fun!
